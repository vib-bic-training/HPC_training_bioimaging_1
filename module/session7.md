# Conclusion and perspectives

## Training

All VIB trainings can be found on [their website](https://training.vib.be/)
The following trainings are interesting for who is interested in HPC, linux, python and reproducibility
- Python course
- GitHub
- Linux and HPC training
- RDM
More advanced topics are:
- Docker and Singularity containers
- Nextflow
- AI course

## Conclusion   and outlook

- Working with HPC is a learning curve but you are not alone in this and it is just a step further than using remote desktop.
- Next to the classical terminal, HPC can be used within a virtual desktop, jupyter notebook and virtual machines (the last option will be investigated soon).
- Of course, using HPC for bioimage analysis is not an isolated phenomena as EMBL, Crick, Liverpool, Dresden, Pasteur and many other do.
- We plan to develop more tailored course in the future and to support you with this transition
