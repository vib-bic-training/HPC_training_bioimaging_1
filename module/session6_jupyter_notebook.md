# Jupyter notebook

## How to start Jupyter notebook
Go to [the Open On Demand portal](https://tier1.hpc.ugent.be/) and log in after multifactor-authentification

Select **Jupyter notebook** or Jupyterlab (maybe more **Jupyter notebook** since you can modify the `Working Directory`) with the following specifications:

Required modules:
- `module load n2v/0.3.2-foss-2022a-CUDA-11.7.0`
- `module load matplotlib/3.5.2-foss-2022a`

## Get the notebook
The notebooks are located in https://github.com/vib-bic-training/HPC_training_bioimaging_1/tree/main/code/notebooks

Download both of them and upload them to your local storage on the VSC using the jupyter interface:
![Exclude labels on edge](/images/jupyter/02_jupyter_notebooks.png)

Then double click on the notebook `n2v_demo_01_training.ipynb` to open it and edit it to change `output_folder`:
```python
output_folder = '/dodrio/scratch/projects/2024_300/<YOUR_NAME>/nv2' #TO CHANGE
```

> [!TIP]
> 
> you could select another place as a `Working Directory`, byt modifying the value when you configure the launch of the jupyter interface
